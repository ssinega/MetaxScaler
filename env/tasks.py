Task definitions for the Support Ticket Environment.

Three difficulty levels are provided. Each task narrows or broadens
what the agent is expected to produce and which fields are scored.

Difficulty    Scored fields
-----------   ---------------------------------------------------
easy          category only
medium        category + priority
hard          category + priority + action + response (keywords)
